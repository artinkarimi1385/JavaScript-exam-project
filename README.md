This project was built as part of my personal journey to learn and improve my JavaScript skills.
It started as a simple idea to create a multiple-choice quiz, but as I kept working on it, I realized it was turning into something much better than I expected — so I decided to polish it and share it with others too.

I didn't use any libraries or frameworks — just pure **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.
The goal was to get my hands dirty with DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, and responsive UI design.

Throughout this project, I tried to focus not just on functionality, but also on making the user experience smooth and enjoyable.
It is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile.

I know it's not perfect, but it represents where I am right now in my learning path — and I'm proud of it.

Thanks for checking it out! If you have feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you.
